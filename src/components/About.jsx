      <p className="max-w-xl text-lg px-4">
      Hey there! I’m Yuvraj Kendre, a 2nd-year BSc student with a passion for coding. My journey through college is a bit unconventional—think less Ivy League and more "Ivy growing on the walls." But hey, who needs a fancy campus when you’ve got the internet, right? <br />

Currently, I’m diving into Express.js and enhancing my skills in the MERN stack. I also hold a diploma in Event Management because organizing code isn’t the only thing I like to juggle. Whether it’s a line of code or a line of guests at an event, I’m committed to making things run smoothly. <br />

I’m serious about my work and focus on building projects that are both functional and impactful. One of my current projects is Ghumte Haii, an innovative platform aimed at solo travelers and adventure enthusiasts. This project offers resources like vehicle information, travel guides, and real-time weather updates, all designed to make travel easier and more enjoyable. In the future, it will evolve into a social media platform, connecting travelers and allowing them to share their experiences. <br />

What Drives Me
I believe that coding is not just about writing lines of code; it’s about creating experiences. My mission is to develop applications that are user-friendly and visually appealing. I’m constantly learning and adapting to new technologies, eager to take on challenges that push my limits. <br />

Current Projects
I’m currently focused on building Ghumte Haii, which aims to provide valuable resources to travelers, ensuring their journeys are safe and enjoyable.<br />

Fun Facts About Me
I’m a firm believer in work-life balance and enjoy attending tech meetups and hackathons to collaborate and share ideas with other developers.
